# A Python assembler for the Hack machine language. @DimitarYordanov17
# The whole idea is to make one main Assembler class, which implement the following functionalities, in order to sucessfully translate .asm (Hack assembly) to .hack (Hack machine code) programs
# 1. Symbolic preprocessor
#   1.1. Jump preprocessor
#   1.2. Variables preprocessor
# 2. Parser
# 3. Code translator

class Assembler:
  '''
  Main class, with no need of initialization, which offers an assemble functionality, to convert .asm to .hack files
  '''

  def assemble():
    '''
    Make use of class methods to reach the goal
